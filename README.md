Decentralized Tendering Platform on Base
Revolutionizing procurement with transparent, trustless, and inclusive onchain tendering.

Traditional tendering systems are slow, opaque, and exclude many capable small businesses due to paperwork, delays, and lack of transparency. Our platform solves this by harnessing the power of blockchain on Base to create a secure, fair, and efficient marketplace for tenders — empowering governments, organizations, and vendors worldwide.

Why It Matters
Transparency & Trust: Every bid, decision, and payment is recorded immutably onchain, eliminating corruption and inefficiency.

Fast & Fair Payments: Stablecoin-based escrow and milestone releases ensure suppliers get paid on time, every time.

Financial Inclusion: Small businesses and freelancers gain equal access to tender opportunities — no bank required.

Global Scale: Cross-border procurement is seamless with instant onchain settlements.

Easy Onboarding: Integrated Basenames and Smart Wallets lower barriers for new users to join and transact.

How It Works
Create & Publish Tenders: Buyers launch tenders onchain with clear rules and milestone criteria.

Submit & Manage Bids: Vendors submit sealed bids using their verified wallets.

Automated Escrow: Funds are locked in smart contracts and only released when milestones are verified.

Full Onchain Audit: All activity is publicly verifiable, enabling trust and compliance.
